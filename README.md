# MuseScore plugin to define shortcuts for a group of actions

## Usage

Just enter the actions you want to do one after another, and the shortcut.

The actions have to be one of the following: <https://github.com/Marr11317/MuseScoreCmdGenerator/blob/master/All.txt>

To add actions, separate them with a ; (semi-colon)

The shortcut has to be valid, following this convention: <https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-4.8/qshortcut.html#key-prop>

There is an experimental shortcut parser, that you can disable by unchecking the `auto` tool button.

For now, you still have to run at least once the plugin to get access to all your shortcuts. But you can declare a shortcut for that ;)
