# MuseScore plugin to define shortcuts for a group of actions

## Usage

Just enter the actions you want to do one after another, and the shortcut.

The actions have to be one of the following: <https://github.com/Marr11317/MuseScoreCmdGenerator/blob/master/All.txt>

To add actions, separate them with a ; (semi-colon)

The shortcut has to be valid, following this convention: <https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-4.8/qshortcut.html#key-prop>

**THIS IS NOT THE CASE BECAUSE OF THIS BUG: <https://musescore.org/en/node/311135#comment-1030086>**
*Note that your defined shortcuts will appear automatically, without having to run the plugin. You should only have to run the plugin to add new shortcuts.*
