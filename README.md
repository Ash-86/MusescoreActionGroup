# MuseScore plugin to define shortcuts for a group of actions

## Usage

Just enter the actions you want to do one after another, and the shortcut.

The actions have to be one of the following: https://github.com/Marr11317/MuseScoreCmdGenerator/blob/master/All.txt

To add actions, separate them with a ; (semi-colon)

The shortcut has to be valid, following this convention: https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-4.8/qshortcut.html#key-prop

Note that your defined shortcuts will appear automatically, without having to run the plugin. You should only have to run the plugin to add new shortcuts.
